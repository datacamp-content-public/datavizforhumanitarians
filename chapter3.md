title: Testing stuff
description: In this chapter we'll teach you how to use qplot to win a fight.  Mastering the ggplot2 language can be overwhelming at first and there is a helper function called qplot() (q for quick plot) which can be used to create the most common types of graphs.  You'll probably be suprised how powerful it is and may be even inspired to go up a weight class later with ggplot.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
